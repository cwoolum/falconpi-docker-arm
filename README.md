# FalconPi - Arm

This is a repo I created to generate a ARM docker image for FalconPi. There weren't any others that I trusted so the idea here is that it builds directly from the normal FPP repo and pushes directly to Docker.

Soon, I'll try to make it so that a new release is created every time a new FPP release occurs.
